# new-arrivals-products-listing-ecommerce
The New arrivals product listing page in Vanilla JS, E-Commerce.


The project’s main functionality is the e-commerce New arrivals product listing browsing through which user has a chance to add the product to Shopping cart, delete the one he does not prefer anymore, manipulate with other controls in cart and add it also to his/her Wish list. 

*	The page showcases the Slideshow, Categories and Deal of the Week components, implemented all in vanilla JS. 
*	Session Storage is used to save the state of the user. 
*	Implemented my own template syntax to avoid adding template dependencies. 
*	The application with all its components is totally responsive.

Note that this is one-page application, so the button ‘Proceed to Checkout’ is not redirecting to respective page, as well as categories listing links in Shop by Categories.
